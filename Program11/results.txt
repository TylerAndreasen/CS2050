Hash Index 3 : Concatenates the ASCII character values of the key, then sums while alternating between
doubling and tripling the value of each digit before adding to the sum. Seemingly quite inefficient.
Hash Table Length :12347:.
Hash Table Slots :161:, Load Factor :0.013039605:.
Hash Table Total-Entries :10868: Load Factor :0.8802138:.
Both of the above included as colliding Hash Table Entries are stored in chains.
On review, the Total-Entry- and Slot-Based Load factors are the same when dealing with such small data sets.
