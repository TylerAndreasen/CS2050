What do I need to build my own version of Flow Free?

Flow - A series of connections between Cells.
    AL<Position> notStack - scalable list of Positions.
    boolean completed - turns true when flow includes two nodes of the same color.

    ensureColorMatch()
        int definedColor = notStack.get(0).getColor;
        for each Position after first
            int testColor = postion.getColor()
            if testColor == -1 || testColor != def
                for each later (inclusive) Position
                    notStack.remove(position);

    checkComplete()
        this.ensureColorMatch()
        if (this.notStack.get(0).isNode() && this.notStack.get(last).isNode())
            completed = true;
            return true;

Position -
    position byte[2] - the position in the level where the flow is.
    boolean isNode - if the Cell is the node of a color.
    int color, which will point to a Swing Color.

    positionMatches(byte[] input)
        if position[0] == input[0] && position[1] == input[1]
            return true;
        return false;

Level
    colors Color[n]
    flows Flow[n]
    nodes Position[2n]

    testClickLocation(byte[2] location) - Attempt to detect a Flow being selected.
        for each flow
            if input location matches the most recent Position
                set the flowToExtend to flow.
            else
                for each cell in the flow starting from the next most recent
                    if input location matches Position


    testDragLocation(byte[2] location) - Attempt to add a Position to a Flow.

    onMouseRelease()
        boolean finished = true;
        for each flow
            if !flow.checkComplete()
                finished = false;
        if finished == true
            return "show finished"
