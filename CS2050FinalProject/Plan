This is a very tentative planning doc, as I do not have a strict assignment page to go off of.

The premise of the assignment is to create an event based simulation which models vehicles
traveling between nodes. We will be given a set of initial vehicles and nodes for them to
travel between.

Each vehicle will have properties like maximum speed, a Decision Tree (BST) to make choices:
to left, right, and freeze, depending on what occurs in the node (if a node blocks traffic in
one direction, the vehicle must turn around).

Nodes will also have data like if they are blocked, but I am less clear on the intended structure.
Each will have a left and right, as the Nodes are a doubly linked list, but not graph, so no up/down.


Node
    Node left, right;
    boolean leftBlocked, rightBlocked;

Vehicle
    static int[] DEFINED_COLORS;
    int maximumSpeed, color;
    BST decisionTree;

BST
    BSTNode root;

BSTNode
    BSTNode left, right;
    int value;
