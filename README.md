# CS2050
  Repo for my CS2050 class

I took Computer Science 2, identified as CS2050, in the Fall of 2023.
Looking back at around the time of this commit has been quite a treat for me, looking back on a class with a quite strict professor, though I appreciated the (usually) clear guidelines.
I am reminded of very helpful tools in Java, especially around file IO (Program9 > Program9.java Line 23, SavingObjectsToFile > ItemDriver.java Line 16)
I am also reminded of the jokes that I left for myself in code (Program9 > Program9.java Line 80).
